# Task Tracker App

This project is currently a beta version and you may encounter bugs

### Task Tracker?

Task tracker is a robust react app where you can track your tasks, under three main panes that are incomplete, payment pending and complete. As the name of the pane's name suggest these are the life cycle stage of any task that you are being paid for goes through.
All your task's information is stored on a server. which can only be accessed using your credential. Currently all the authentication is done using symmetric encryption. So, try not to access this website on a compromised network as the attacker might gain access through the requests.
This problem will be tackled with later updates with authentication using email and encrypted tokens.
Please contact if you encounter any bugs @ [TBD](#).
